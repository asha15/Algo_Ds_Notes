COMB SORT 

Comb sort is an improvement of the bubble sort algoritham.In the comb sort,the items are sorted
in a specific gap.After completing each phase,the gap decreased.

With compared to the bubble sort this sorting algoritham remove the worst-case scenario 
and improved on the time complexity of Bubble sort.


Example

Let's arrange the numbers in ascending order using Comb sort.
